# Weather-Tracker
A Repository for a Homemade Weather Tracking App

This Weather tracker will allow for you to put any city in the world into search bar and acquire both the current weather conditions of that city and the forecast for the next five days! This tracker pulls information in from the Weather API as wells as Awesome Fonts, Bootstrap, JQUER, and Day JS. This project was an amazing stretch for me to learn how fetch requests are both triggered and resolved! This web app could be further expanded with geospatial location API to set the starting location to the user's current location. 

This current version of my weather tracker features several things.

1). A search bar that can locate any major city in the world and fetch it's weather from the Weather API
2). The cities are stored in the history bar and can be reselected! Just click on them.
3). Any city clicked on recylces back to the top!
4). The current forecast as well as the next five day forecast are presented on the page.
5). Distinctive icons describe the weather to the user based on the fetched data.
